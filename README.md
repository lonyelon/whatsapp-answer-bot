# whatsapp-answer-bot

A bot made to reply for you to those messages you dont want to.

# Building

You need `nodejs` to run this project.
If you already have it run the following commands to build and run the project:

```sh
echo "[]" > chats.json
npm install venom
node index.js
```

# Usage

Once the bot is running,
scan the QR code that it gives with *Whatsapp* to link it to your phone.

To make it work in a chat someone
(not the one running the bot)
has to send a message saying `!bot`.
